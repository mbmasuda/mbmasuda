# 👋 Hi, I’m @mbmasuda

You can see some work-related details about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marimasuda/), including how
I twice saved Jeff Bezos from embarrassment.

#### Non-work-related tidbits about me include:
*  I somehow [managed to teach my dog to pee in a litter box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mr1pz_Gd_jo) and I think
   the number of people who have watched this video is super hilarious. I know COVID lockdowns were rough, but seriously,
   don't you have a better way to spend a minute and 42 seconds of your life? I uploaded this video as a joke back in the
   days when YouTube had a 10 minute limit.
*  I have a [personal web page](https://mari.masuda.me) that I update ***extremely*** infrequently. It's probably the only
   website on the internet that does not use cookies these days, but if you are interested in reading some papers I wrote
   in college about classical music, you might enjoy checking it out.
*  Perhaps stupidly, the U.S. government allowed me to be responsible for a giant helicopter, despite me having what I
   believe to be the world's worst sense of direction, as well as a complete inability to drive a stick shift. Not sure
   what Uncle Sam was thinking, but it allowed me to have my own personal Forrest Gump moment when I had a group photo-op
   with then-President George W. Bush when he landed on *USS Abraham Lincoln (CVN-72)* for the "Mission Accomplished"
   speech. Pro tip: if you're going to have a presidential photo-op, it's a good thing to be the shortest person in the
   room because then you can be in the picture right next to the president.
